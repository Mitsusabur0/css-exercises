---SELECTORS (syntax: selector + {})

universal: 
	"*"
	every element

type: 
	"name of element"
	all elements of that type

class: 
	".class-name"
	elements of given class
	classes are attributes placed inside the html element

	ex: <p class="example"> 

	an element an be given multiple classes, separated by a space inside the class declaration

ID:
	"#idname"
	IDs are attributes placed inside the html element

	ex: <p id="example">

	an element can only have one ID
	an ID cannot be repeated on a single page

---


Grouping Selectors
	can give declarations to multiple selectors by a list separated by commas

		ex: .test1, .test2 {}
	
Chaining Selectors
	elements that have two selectors (ex: <p class="test1 test2">)
	can be selected by chaining them

		ex: .test1.test2 {}

	this would select any element that has both classes
	this method can be used with different selectors

		ex: ".test1#test2 {}"

Descendant Combinator
	combinators show a relationship between selectors
	it's represented by a single space between selectors

		ex: .ancestor .test1 {}

	selects elements that match the last selector, as long as they have an ancestor selector
	that matches the previous selector
	ancestor selectors are those in which the selector is nested

		ex: <div class="ancestor">
			<div class:"test1">
		    <div class: "test1">

	the first element would be selected, the last would not
	there's no limit of combinators

	
	


---COLORS

color
	"keyword or RGB, etc"

background-color
	same as ^

---TEXT

font-family
	"name in quotes"
	list separated by commas, indicating desired order and giving generic 
	font family as fallback

font-size
	"number + px", no spaces

font-weight
	Indicates boldness, number from "1-1000"

text-align
	"keyword"

---IMAGES

height
	"number + px", no spaces
	"auto" for it to not lose proportions
width
	same as ^




---CSS Cascade
When rules conflict with one another, there's a specific cascade that determinse 
which rule is applied
Factors:

Specificity
	+specific > -specific
	1- ID
	2- class
	3- type

	amount of each selector type
	a more specific selector
	
Inheritance
	Refeers to certain properties that when applied to an element, are also applied
	to that element's descendants, even if not explicitly stated
	Targeting a specific child takes prescedence tho

Rule Order
	Final factor is rule order
	If everything else is the same, the last rule declared takes prescedence


---ADDING CSS TO HTML

External CSS
	Creating separete file (usually style.css) which has all the rules in it
	its called inside <head> with a self closing <link> element
		ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

Internal CSS
	Adding CSS within the HTML file, placed inside the <head> tags with the <style> tags
	Useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website
	It's not recommended

Inline CSS
	Add styles directly to HTML elements
	Selectors are not used, as the property is being added directly in the opening tag
		ex: <div style="color: white; background-color:black;>...</div>
	Unique style to a single element
	It can get messy quickly, beware of using it
